With its ability to handle massive amounts of data and provide high availability, Cassandra has become a go-to choice for many AI applications including \nUber\n, \nNetflix\n, and \nPriceline\n. However, with the introduction of generative AI and large language models (LLMs), new query capabilities are needed.\u00a0\nEnter vector search, a revolutionary new feature that empowers Cassandra with enhanced search and retrieval functionalities for generative AI applications. As a preview for our community, we\u2019ve made it available in DataStax Astra DB to try out and provide us with feedback. Get started by \nsigning up\n and then \ntrying the demo\n.\u00a0\nWhat is vector search?\nVector search\n is a cutting-edge approach to searching and retrieving data that leverages the power of vector similarity calculations. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, which matches documents based on the occurrence of specific terms, vector search focuses on the semantic meaning and similarity of data points. By representing data as vectors in a high-dimensional space, vector search enables more accurate and intuitive search results.\u00a0\nFor example, vector search easily identifies the semantics in these examples that term-based search would struggle with:\nFalse positive: \u201cMan bites dog\u201d and \u201cdog bites man\u201d include the same words but have opposite semantics.\nFalse negative: \u201cTourism numbers are collapsing\u201d and \u201cTravel industry fears Covid-19 crisis will cause more companies to enter bankruptcy\u201d have very similar meanings but different word choices and specificity.\nFalse negative: \u201cI need a new phone\u201d and \u201cMy old device is broken\u201d have related meanings but no common words.\nIntegrating vector search with Cassandra\nThe integration of vector search with Cassandra (for details, see \nCEP-30\n) offers several\u00a0 benefits. It opens up exciting possibilities for applications that require similarity-based queries\u2014and not just for text. Applications as diverse as recommendation systems, fraud detection, image recognition, and natural language processing can all benefit from vector search.\nHere are some key advantages of incorporating vector search into Cassandra:\nUnstructured data queries\nPrior to vector search, Cassandra was limited to searching structured data (floats, integers, or full strings). Vector search now opens the possibilities to query unstructured data, including text, audio, pictures, and videos. This makes Cassandra the one-stop-shop for high-scale database applications.\u00a0\nEnhanced search accuracy\nVector search allows for similarity-based queries, enabling more accurate and relevant search results. By considering the semantic meaning of data points, it can uncover hidden relationships and patterns that traditional keyword searches might miss.\nEfficient query processing\u00a0\nWith vector search, Cassandra can perform similarity calculations and ranking directly within the database. This eliminates the need to transfer large amounts of data to external systems, reducing latency and improving overall query performance. Furthermore, you can combine vector search with other Cassandra indexes for even more powerful queries to find exactly the data you need.\nScalability and distributed processing\nCassandra's distributed architecture aligns perfectly with vector search requirements. As data volumes grow, vector search can leverage Cassandra's scalability and distributed processing capabilities to handle large-scale similarity queries efficiently.\nBroad applicability\nVector search provides the flexibility to compute similarity across various types of data, including text, numerical values, images, and \nembeddings\n. This versatility enables developers to build advanced applications that span multiple domains and data types, all within the Cassandra ecosystem.\nVector search use cases\nIt seems that not a day goes by when a new, innovative application of generative AI is invented. Almost all generative AI use cases are enhanced by vector search because it allows developers to create more relevant prompts. Use cases of vector search for generative AI include:\nQuestion answering\u00a0\nConverting documents to text embeddings can be combined with modern natural language processing (NLP) to deliver full text answers to questions. This approach spares users from studying lengthy manuals and empowers your teams to provide answers more quickly. A \"question answering\" generative AI model can take the text-embedding representation for both the knowledge base of documents and your current question to deliver the closest match as an \"answer.\" (\ncode\n)\nSemantic search\nVector search powers semantic or similarity search. Because the meaning and context is captured in the embedding, vector search finds what users mean, without requiring an exact keyword match. It works with textual data (documents), images, and audio, to, for example, easily and quickly help users find products that are similar or related to their query.\nSemantic caching\u00a0\nAs your generative application grows in popularity and encounters higher traffic levels, the expenses related to LLM API calls can become substantial. Additionally, LLM services might exhibit slow response times, especially when dealing with a significant number of requests. Caching LLM responses can significantly increase response times, and lower the cost of using generative AI. However, to match the input of an LLM to previous input requires performing a semantic match rather than an exact match. Vector search provides users with that ability. (\ncode\n)\nA brief overview of transformers\u2014and their challenges\nTo gain deeper insight into the value of vector search in the domain of generative AI, it\u2019s important to understand what transformers are and what their limitations are. Transformers are designed to understand the context and semantics of language by taking in a sequence of tokens (words, or parts of words) and outputting a corresponding sequence. These models pay attention to each input token and the relationships between them, using a mechanism known as self-attention or scaled dot-product attention. This enables them to understand complex linguistic constructs and generate coherent and contextually accurate responses.\nDespite their capabilities, transformers face a significant challenge: the token limit. This constraint arises due to memory limitations in the computational hardware. With large input sequences, the self-attention mechanism requires storing each token's relationship with every other token, which can quickly exhaust available memory. As a result, transformers like GPT-3 or GPT-4 have a limit on the number of tokens they can process in a single pass; it\u2019s typically a few thousand tokens.\u00a0\nVector search solves this problem by retrieving the most semantically relevant data so that we can get the most value possible from the limited token window. Take for example a Q&A chatbot for a software product. Instead of passing the Q&A chatbot the entire Q&A repository for a software product, or using term-based search that can easily retrieve unrelated information, vector search enables you to selectively query for semantically relevant content to use the token limit effectively. (\ncode\n)\nAnother example is chat history. LLMs use chat history to give context to what the user has discussed with the LLM in the past. Simply using a fixed number of the last interactions to prevent going over the token limit would result in LLMs forgetting the previous context of the conversations. Vector search allows for only relevant historical conversations to be passed to the LLM (\ncode\n).\nBeyond the technical constraint, there's a cost aspect as well. Each token processed by the transformer uses computational resources, which directly translates into financial cost. Therefore, when using transformers in your applications, it's important to maximize the value extracted from each token within the given limit. Vector search reduces the cost aspect by first optimizing the content that is populated in the prompt, then also intelligently caching its responses.(\ncode\n)\nCassIO: integrating vector search into your generative AI app\nTo accelerate the integration of vector search into your app, we\u2019ve also created a library called CassIO. This software framework integrates seamlessly with popular LLM software such as \nLangChain\n, making it easy to leverage vector search in your database. CassIO can maintain chat history, create prompt templates, and cache LLM responses. To learn more, check out\u00a0 the \nCassIO website\n.\nGet started!\nCassandra and Astra DB developers can take a great leap forward with vector search. Today, Cassandra is the number one database for querying both structured and unstructured data. Understanding the strengths and limitations of transformers and using advanced data management technologies like DataStax can greatly enhance the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of generative AI applications.

To simplify its setup, the suite includes the ZDM Utility. This interactive utility creates a Docker container acting as the Ansible Control Host. The Ansible playbooks constitute the ZDM Proxy Automation.\nCassandra Data Migrator\n is designed to:\nConnect to your clusters and compare the data between Origin and Target\nReport differences in a detailed log file\nReconcile any missing records and fix any data inconsistencies between Origin and Target, if you enable \nautocorrect\n in a configuration file\nDSBulk Migrator\n is provided to migrate smaller amounts of data from Origin to Target\nWell-defined steps in this migration documentation, organized as a sequence of phases.\nWhat exactly is ZDM Proxy?\nZDM Proxy is a component designed to seamlessly handle the real-time client application activity while a migration is in progress. See \nhere\n for an overview.\nWhat are the benefits of Zero Downtime Migration and its use cases?\nMigrating client applications between clusters is a need that arises in many scenarios. For example, you may want to:\nMove to a cloud-native, managed service such as Astra DB.\nMigrate your client application to a brand new cluster, on a more recent version and perhaps on new infrastructure, or even a different CQL database entirely, without intermediate upgrade steps and ensuring that you always have an easy way to rollback in case of issues.\nSeparate out a client application from a shared cluster to a dedicated one.\nConsolidate client applications, currently running on separate clusters, into fewer clusters or even a single one.\nBottom line: You want to migrate your critical database infrastructure without risk or concern that your users' experiences will be affected.\nWhich releases of Cassandra or DSE are supported for migrations?\nOverall, you can use ZDM Proxy to migrate:\nFrom:\n Any Cassandra 2.1.6 or higher release, or from any DSE 4.7.1 or higher release\nTo:\n Any equivalent or higher release of Cassandra, or to any equivalent or higher release of DSE, or to Astra DB\nThere are many reasons why you may decide to migrate your data and client applications from one cluster to another, for example:\nMoving to a different type of CQL database, for example an on-demand cloud-based proposition such as Astra DB.\nUpgrading a cluster to a newer version, or newer infrastructure, in as little as one step while leaving your existing cluster untouched throughout the process.\nMoving one or more client applications out of a shared cluster and onto a dedicated one, in order to manage and configure each cluster independently.\nConsolidating client applications, which may be currently running on separate clusters, onto a shared one in order to reduce overall database footprint and maintenance overhead.\nHere are just a few examples of migration scenarios that are supported when moving from one type of CQL-based database to another:\nFrom an existing self-managed Cassandra or DSE cluster to cloud-native Astra DB. For example:\nCassandra 2.1.6+, 3.11.x, 4.0.x, or 4.1.x to Astra DB\nDSE 4.7.1+, 4.8.x, 5.1.x, 6.7.x or 6.8.x to Astra DB\nFrom an existing Cassandra or DSE cluster to another Cassandra or DSE cluster. For example:\nCassandra 2.1.6+ or 3.11.x to Cassandra 4.0.x or 4.1.x\nDSE 4.7.1+, 4.8.x, 5.1.x or 6.7.x to DSE 6.8.x\nCassandra 2.1.6+, 3.11.x, 4.0.x, or 4.1.x to DSE 6.8.x\nDSE 4.7.1+ or 4.8.x to Cassandra 4.0.x or 4.1.x\nFrom \nAstra DB Classic\n to \nAstra DB Serverless\nFrom any CQL-based database type/version to the equivalent CQL-based database type/version.\nDoes ZDM migrate clusters?\nZDM does not migrate clusters. With ZDM, we are migrating data and applications \nbetween clusters\n.  At the end of the migration, your application will be running on your new cluster, which will have been populated with all the relevant data.\nWhat challenges does ZDM solve?\nBefore DataStax Zero Downtime Migration was available, migrating client applications between clusters involved granular and intrusive client application code changes, extensive migration preparation, and a window of downtime to the client application\u2019s end users.\nZDM allows you to leverage mature migration tools that have been used with large scale enterprises and applications to make migrations easy and transparent to end users.\nWhat is the pricing model?\nThe suite of Zero Downtime Migration tools from DataStax is free and open-sourced.\nIs there support available if I have questions or issues during our migration?\nIf needed, ZDM Proxy and related software tools in the migration suite include technical assistance by \nDataStax Support\n, if you have a DataStax Luna service contract with DataStax.Luna\n is a subscription to the Apache Cassandra support and expertise at DataStax.\nFor any observed problems with the ZDM Proxy, submit a \nGitHub Issue\n in the ZDM Proxy GitHub repo.\nAdditional examples serve as templates, from which you can learn about migrations. DataStax does not assume responsibility for making the templates work for specific use cases.\nWhere are the public GitHub repos?\nAll the DataStax Zero Downtime Migration GitHub repos are public and open source. You are welcome to read the code and submit feedback via GitHub Issues per repo. In addition to sending feedback, you may submit Pull Requests (PRs) for potential inclusion. To submit PRs, you must for first agree to the \nDataStax Contribution License Agreement (CLA)\n.\nZDM Proxy\n repo for ZDM Proxy.\nZDM Proxy Automation\n repo for the Ansible-based ZDM Proxy Automation, which includes the ZDM Utility.\ncassandra-data-migrator\n repo for the tool that supports migrating larger data quantities as well as detailed verifications and reconciliation options.\ndsbulk-migrator\n repo for the tool that allows simple data migrations without validation and reconciliation capabilities.\nDoes ZDM Proxy support Transport Layer Security (TLS)?\nYes, and here\u2019s a summary:\nFor application-to-proxy TLS, the application is the TLS client and the ZDM Proxy is the TLS server. One-way TLS and Mutual TLS are both supported.\nFor proxy-to-cluster TLS, the ZDM Proxy acts as the TLS client and the cluster as the TLS server. One-way TLS and Mutual TLS are both supported.\nWhen the ZDM Proxy connects to Astra DB clusters, it always implicitly uses Mutual TLS. This is done through the Secure Connect Bundle (SCB) and does not require any extra configuration.\nFor TLS details, see \nConfigure Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n.\nHow does ZDM Proxy handle Lightweight Transactions (LWTs)?\nZDM Proxy handles LWTs as write operations. The proxy sends the LWT to Origin and Target clusters concurrently, and waits for a response from both. ZDM Proxy will return a \nsuccess\n status to the client if both Origin and Target send successful acknowledgements, or otherwise will return a \nfailure\n status if one or both do not return an acknowledgement.\nWhat sets LWTs apart from regular writes is that they are conditional. For important details, including the client context for a returned \napplied\n flag, see \nLightweight Transactions and the \napplied\n flag\n.\nCan ZDM Proxy be deployed as a sidecar?\nZDM Proxy should not be deployed as a sidecar.\nZDM Proxy was designed to mimic a Cassandra cluster. For this reason, we recommend deploying multiple ZDM Proxy instances, each running on a dedicated machine, instance, or VM.\nFor best performance, this deployment should be close to the client applications (ideally on the same local network) but not co-deployed on the same machines as the client applications. This way, each client application instance can connect to all ZDM Proxy instances, just as it would connect to all nodes in a Cassandra cluster (or datacenter).\nThis deployment model gives maximum resilience and failure tolerance guarantees and allows the client application driver to continue using the same load balancing and retry mechanisms that it would normally use.\nConversely, deploying a single ZDM Proxy instance would undermine this resilience mechanism and create a single point of failure, which could affect the client applications if one or more nodes of the underlying clusters (Origin or Target) go offline. In a sidecar deployment, each client application instance would be connecting to a single ZDM Proxy instance, and would therefore be exposed to this risk.\nFor more information, see \nChoosing where to deploy the proxy\n.\nWhat are the benefits of using a cloud-native database?\nWhen moving your client applications and data from on-premise Cassandra Query Language (CQL) based data stores (Cassandra or DSE) to a cloud-native database (CNDB) like Astra DB, it\u2019s important to acknowledge the fundamental differences ahead. With on-premise infrastructure, of course, you have total control of the datacenter\u2019s physical infrastructure, software configurations, and your custom procedures. At the same time, with on-premise clusters you take on the cost of infrastructure resources, maintenance, operations, and personnel.\nRanging from large enterprises to small teams, IT managers, operators, and developers are realizing that the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) with cloud solutions is much lower than continuing to run on-prem physical data centers.\nA CNDB like Astra DB is a different environment. Running on proven cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, Astra DB greatly reduces complexity and increases convenience by surfacing a subset of configurable settings, providing a well-designed UI known as Astra Portal, plus a set of APIs and commands to interact with your Astra DB organizations and databases.\nComponents\nPreliminary steps\nRate this article"}, {"url": "https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/astra-faq.html", "title": "Astra DB FAQs :: DataStax Astra DB Serverless Documentation", "content": "Astra DB FAQs\nContents\nWhat tools does Astra DB include?\nHow is Astra DB different from DSE?\nWhich version of Apache Cassandra\u2122 is compatible with Astra DB?\nWhat is a Vector Search?\nWhich cloud vendors does Astra DB support?\nHow do I connect to Astra DB databases?\nWhat does DataStax consider \u201crecent\u201d when listing Recent Resources?\nWhich DataStax drivers work with Astra DB?\nHow do I manage billing for Astra DB?\nWhat happens when my monthly credit runs out?\nWhere do I find the Database ID and Organization ID?\nHow do I navigate to a CQL shell?\nI am trying to create a keyspace in the CQL shell, and I am running into an error.

See \nDefining an LDAP scheme\n.\nCan access be restricted using IP accesslisting and blocklisting?\n \nIn general, arbitrary client programs do not access the database.\nDatabase access by the general user population is controlled at the application layer.\nApplication node to database node access should be controlled by using conventional firewall mechanisms, such as Linux iptables.\nHowever, database administrators are an exception to allow connections from DBA hosts.\nWhat granularity of access to specific elements of data is supported?\n \nAuthorization is granted or revoked at the row level for data.\nWhat is the difference between RBAC and RLAC\n \nRole-based access control (RBAC) refers to authorization to any database resource including row-level access control (RLAC).\nRow-level access control refers to the feature that allows permissions to be granted/revoked on rows within a table by filtering a text-based partition column.\nRow-level Access Control (RLAC)\nFor details, see \nsetting up row-level permissions\n.\nHow do I restrict access to a row?\n \nEach table can have a single UTF-8 partition key column on which you build filters to grant access (separate command) to rows within the table.\nRESTRICT only sets the filtering column name:\nRESTRICT ROWS ON [<keyspace_name>.]<table_name>\nUSING <partition_key>;\nAfter setting the column name, use the GRANT command to configure access to rows.\nCan I unrestrict access to rows in a table with RLAC authorization?\n \nThe partition key to filter on using GRANT can be unselected from the table:\nUNRESTRICT ROWS ON [<keyspace_name>.]<table_name>\nUSING <partition_key>;\nUse the LIST command on the table to display all roles that have been granted permissions.\nUnrestricting the column does not grant access to all columns within the table; it invalidates existing filters.\nUsers that are granted access with a filter are unable to access any rows within the table.\nTo grant permissions to all rows, grant permission on the table to the role.\nHow do I grant permissions for rows in a table?\n \nConfigure access to rows within a table by specifying a filtering string that is applied to the partition key column selected in the \nRESTRICT\n command.\nUse case-sensitive literal text in the filter string.\nRow-level authorization applies only to rows that exactly match the filtering_data.\nYou can create as many \nRLAC\n grant variations as required by your security policies.\nTo allow access to rows within a table:\nGRANT <permission>\non '<filtering_data>' ROWS IN <keyspace_name>.<table_name>\nto <role_name>;\nUse the LIST command to display all permissions a role has on a resource.\nHow do I revoke permissions for rows in a table?\n \nRow permissions are stored based on the filtering string, to remove a permission use the REVOKE command with the exact filtering string you want to remove:\nREVOKE <permission> on '<filtering_data>' ROWS IN <keyspace_name>.<table_name>;\nLIST ALL PERMISSIONS ON TABLE <table_name> shows all filters granted to roles.\nWhat happens if you run a RESTRICT command on a table that already has a restriction?\n \nTables have only a single restriction.\nRunning the \nRESTRICT\n command replaces the existing restriction.\nUse \nDESCRIBE TABLE\n to view the existing restrictions on the table.\nWhat happens if there a role has access to the keyspace/table level and I grant row access?\n \nPermission is hierarchical, if permission was also granted to the keyspace or table the user has access to all rows in the table.\nThe \nRLAC\n permissions have no affect.\nIs RLAC supported for use with DSE Graph?\n \nNo.\nAlthough permissions are shown and errors are not thrown with this statement:\nGRANT SELECT ON 'custom_key' ROWS IN graph_keyspace.graph_table to 'alice';\nPermissions are not enforced.\nRLAC is not supported for use with DSE Graph.\nGranting access on rows in a table provides access to data in all graph keyspaces.\nEncryption\nHow are encryption keys secured and managed?\n \nEncryption keys can be managed off-server or locally:\nKMIP\n (Key Management Interoperability Protocol) encryption for encryption keys stored on another server and are cached locally in the memory heap when used by DSE.\nUse \nlocal encryption\n keys and secure using Linux permissions to restrict access.\nCan the client-to-node encryption be configured as a two-way SSL?\n \nYes, although the client certificate DN is not used as a database user principal.\nClient-to-node encryption protects in-flight data from client machines to a\ndatabase cluster using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and establishes a secure\nchannel between the client and the coordinator node.\nHow is encryption of \nat-rest data\n supported?\n \nProtects sensitive at-rest data using a local encryption key file or remotely stored and managed Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) encryption key.\nCan encryption keys be changed for a particular table?\n \nYes, by designating transparent data encryption (TDE) on a per table basis.\nUsing encryption, your application can read and write to SSTables that use different encryption algorithms or use no encryption at all.\nUse a single \nALTER TABLE\n statement to set encryption and compression.\nWould encryption of EBS in AWS be a good replacement for using TDE, or is EBS better as a supplement to TDE (or neither)?\n \nEBS encryption is another way to encrypt the data files.\nEBS encryption ensures encryption of audit logs, system logs, and the SSTable index files, which have partition keys in plain text when using TDE.\nIn general, EBS encryption may be operationally simpler.\nPrimarily, use TDE when full-disk encryption is cost prohibitive or not feasible.\nIs encryption supported at granular data layers? For example record-level or column- or field-level?\n \nNo.\nDesignate transparent data encryption (TDE) only on a per table basis.\nAuditing\nWhich user actions and events are logged?\n \nWhen you \nconfigure audit logging\n, you can include or exclude categories of database activity such as querying or DML, see \nFiltering event categories\n.\nWhere are audit logs stored and who has access?\n \nAudit logs can be written to either file system log files using \nlogback\n, or to a database table.\nAudit events stored in database tables can be secured like any other database table using RBAC.\nFile-based audit logs are stored per-node and can be secured with standard Linux file system permissions.\nAbout DSE Advanced Security\nSecurity checklists\nRate this article"}]
